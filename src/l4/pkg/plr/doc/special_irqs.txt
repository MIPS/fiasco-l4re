         Romain Special Interrupt Values
=================================================

Applications can issue "magic interrupts" to trigger features in the Romain
master process. These interrupts are used to implement debugging features. They
are triggered by issuing an x86 INT instruction with a respective parameter.



INT 0x41 -- NOOP
----------------

The noop syscall does nothing but trigger an exception visible to the master.
The intention is to use this syscall to trigger state comparison at arbitrary
points in time.


INT 0x42 -- Enable Logging
--------------------------

Turn on full logging in the master. This can also be configured in the INI
file, but sometimes you want to run your program up to a certain point before
triggering full output.
