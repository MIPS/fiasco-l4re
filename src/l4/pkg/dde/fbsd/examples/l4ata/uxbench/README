uxbench is a hdd performance measuring utility for Linux and BSD and maybe
others. It is the pendant to l4/pkg/bddf/clients/bddfbench. Both read the
first n (1..4096) sectors of a disk with a single request. This is done
repeatedly.
Results are printed to stderr during measurement and to stdout at the end.
So you can redirect it to a file using "> blah.txt", but see the progress.

There is a perl script called makestats which reads the output of
bddfbench and uxbench and calculates the mean and the standard deviation
per transfer block size. The output of this script can easily be used
with gnuplot.

You need to patch your Linux/... kernel in order to have rdtsc and rdpmc
work in userspace, which is needed for uxbench.
