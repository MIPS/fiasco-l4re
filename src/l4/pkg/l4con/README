Lightweight L4 console.

This packages provides a simple L4 console. Clients communicate with the
console server using the pSLIM protocol as proposed by SUN at the 17th SOSP
1999. SLIM is the abbreviation [S]tateless [L]ow level [I]nterface [M]achine).
The 'p' in pSLIM stays for 'pseudo' because we had no access to the original
SUN implementation.

There exist stubs for L4Linux and XFree86 4.1. The console is able to use
some basic hardware acceleration and supports Matrox Gxx, ATI Mach64, S3
Savage cards and the VMware's builtin display driver. The video mode has
to be set by the GRUB bootloader.
