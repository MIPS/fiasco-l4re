Do the following to compile a Linux to be used as a guest.

I used Linux-3.14.1, 3.15 and 3.16

Select the 'multi_v7_defconfig' config:

$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- multi_v7_defconfig
$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- menuconfig

Enable at least:
CONFIG_VIRTIO_CONSOLE

and probably some RAM disk support or similar.

Beginners may also want to enable those:
DEBUG_LL
DEBUG_ICEDCC
EARLY_PRINTK


Build the kernel
$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- -j40

Then use arch/arm/boot/zImage


Use an appropriate device tree file from dts/ directory.

IO configurations are in bsp/platform


Caveats with at least 3.14.1, 3.15 and 3.16:
 - With the multiplatform config enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_LL /
   CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK selects the PL0X1 debug UART because of some
   (unfortunate?) settings in arch/arm/Kconfig.debug.  Remove / modify the
   CONFIG_DEBUG_UART_PL01X option in a way so that CONFIG_DEBUG_LL_INCLUDE
   is set to debug/icedcc.S and also select CONFIG_DEBUG_ICEDCC
   accordingly. If this is given, early-printk should work.
 - The Linux boot code misses an 'ISB' instruction that might hit in your
   setup. You'll be seeing unresolvable page-faults or other unusual
   behavior if you hit it. The issue triggers depending on memory layout.

   According to the internet, a patch is floating around for this which
   hopefully gets merged soon.
