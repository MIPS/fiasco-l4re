  This is DDELinux 2.6.29

Directory structure
###################

'contrib/'
==========

This directory tree holds unmodified Linux sources. The files residing here
are sourced by Makefiles in 'examples' and 'lib'. All unmodified C headers are
also kept here.


'include/'
==========

Currently reimplemented and modified C headers as well as the DDELinux 2.6 API
definition are kept in this directory tree.

Include stuff works as following. First, we install all Linux headers from
contrib/include to the build directory. Thereafter, we pull in our
modifications by installing all header files from include/ to the appropriate
include paths, thereby overwriting the original versions. 


'lib/src/arch/l4'
=================

Contains reimplementations of Linux functions that are implemented differently
in our environment or that are mapped to DDEKit calls. There are no Linux
functions included here.


'lib/src/<linux subdir name>'
=============================

When we import functions from Linux instead of reimplementing them, we copy
the whole Linux source file containing this function to this location. We then
modify the file according to our needs, mostly by wrapping unneeded parts with
'#ifndef DDE_LINUX .. #endif' blocks.


'examples/'
==========

Here reside test code and example drivers.
