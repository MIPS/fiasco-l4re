Miscellaneous functionality not belonging to other packages.

This package implements some functionality which doesn't fit into other
packages, mainly to support some features of a C library and to support some
features of the L4 microkernel:

- programming of the Local APIC of x86 processors (PPro+)
- using the time stamp counter of x86 processors (Pentium+)
- using the performance counters of x86 processors (Pentium+)
- atomic operations (compare and exchange)
- bit and bit field manipulation operations
- x86 port I/O (in/out)
- x86 cli/sti, irq_acknowledge for the fully special nested mode
- comfortable parsing of command line arguments
- a simple random number generator
- touching memory to preclude later pagefaults
- a very simple lock implementation (better use the L4env lock package)
- a simple function for creating threads (better use the L4env thread package)
- etc.
