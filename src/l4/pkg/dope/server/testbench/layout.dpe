# Bug found my Martin:
# The window's size was not correctly updated
# after the s_b0 was added to the Grid.
# It occured when I changed wid_do_layout.

win = new Window()
g1 = new Grid()
win.set(-content g1 -x 5 -y 400)
win.open()
g_cont = new Grid()
g1.place(g_cont, -column 1 -row 2)
temp = new Label()
temp.set(-text "0:                 rt_mon_hist_demo")
g_cont.place(temp, -column 1 -row 1)
s_b0 = new Button()
s_b0.set(-text Show)
g_cont.place(s_b0, -column 2 -row 1)
