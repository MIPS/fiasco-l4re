Input driver library -- L4INPUT.

This package provides an API to input device drivers. The drivers are part of a
library, i.e. colocated with the application using it. Packages using L4INPUT
are CON and DOpE. L4INPUT supports PS/2 aux and kbd.

It's a bad idea to use two applications linked with input in one system as
there should only be one device driver per specific device.

HINT: Fiasco must not be started with deprecated "-esc" command line switch;
use "-serial_esc" instead. Otherwise, L4INPUT cannot initialize i8042 or
behaves really strange because Fiasco also programs input ports.

ALL Linux 2.6 sources included in this package are GPLed (as you know).
