/*
 * Some words about the sysenter entry frame: Since the sysenter instruction
 * automatically reloads the instruction pointer (eip) and the stack pointer
 * (esp) after kernel entry, we have to save both registers preliminary to
 * that instruction. We use ecx to store the user-level esp and save eip onto
 * the stack. The ecx register contains the IPC timeout and has to be saved
 * onto the stack, too. The ebp register is saved for compatibility reasons
 * with the Hazelnut kernel. Both the esp and the ss register are also pushed
 * onto the stack to be able to return using the "lret" instruction from the
 * sysexit trampoline page if Small Address Spaces are enabled.
