Step 1) HOWTO.l4re - How to get started building and running Fiasco.OC + L4

Step 2) HOWTO.karma - How to build and run a para-virtualized linux as a Guest
OS using the Karma Virtual Machine Monitor running on Fiasco.OC + L4Re.

Use the following branches for Fiasco/L4Re, Karma, Linux:

Fiasco/L4Re
   mips-next     - newer mips fiasco port based on upstream svn r67
   fiasco-mips32 - initial mips fiasco port based on upstream svn r54

Karma
   mips-next     - newer mips fiasco port based on upstream svn r67
   devel-mips    - initial mips fiasco port based on upstream svn r54

Linux
   karma_mips_3.10.14 - same branch for both svn r54 and svn r67
