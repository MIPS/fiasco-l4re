Basic L4 IPC/Syscall Bindings and Type Definitions.

This package defines the application binary interface (ABI) to the L4 kernel.
Currently there are two versions supported: Version 2 as originally implemented
by Jochen Liedtke and Version X.0 as defined in the appropriate specification
and implemented by the L4Ka Hazelnut kernel. Note that the latter interface
is emulated using a few assembler instructions. This makes it possible to use
the same source code for the two different versions. To support plain X.0
functionality we have to create additional IPC bindings which take three
DWord arguments to be transferred.
